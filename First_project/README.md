My project name is First_project

I am the sole contributor of this project.

This project is a portfolio meant to showcase previous works and inform companies of my potential value as an intern.

The technologies used were a MacBook Air, Terminal, and VS Code.

To setup all you have to do is copy the link from the repository and do a git pull, or clone.

There are no known bugs.
