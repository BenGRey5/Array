<p><span class="fancy">Iâ€™m an aspiring coder, and a dedicated worker. At each of the jobs that I worked at the common thing they had to say about me was that I was dilligent in my work and very likable as a person. In the work place I value honesty and respect very highly and am quick to integrate into the role that is expected of me. No matter the task, whatever the job, I will do my level best.
